Reading scientific papers is difficult and time consuming; it’s even more tedious when you’re on
a mobile device. Most people just read the headline and let their confirmation bias take over.
What if we could create a tool to quickly evaluate the overall merit of an article, to let the user
know how solid the conclusion is. News articles are notorious for exaggerating or
misinterpreting the findings of a study. When scrolling through your morning news feed,
imagine how convenient it would be to click on the link to the study and have our app do the
critical analysis for you.
